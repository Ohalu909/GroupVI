# THE SOCIOPATH PROJECT
by Group VI 

## Description

The Sociopath Project is all about friendhip monitoring system. Admit that, online learning is boring. No face-to-face, no interaction, no campus life! You donâ€™t even know if one is reliable when working on assignments together. To run away from divers and build up your personal reputation, we built a friendship monitoring system based on what we have learnt in WIA1002 DATA STRUCTURE course.
